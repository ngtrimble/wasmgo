# wasmgo

Demonstrates use of WASM with Go and a JS shim that comes with Go to manipulate
the DOM. The support that comes from WASM and Go is fairly basic. This shows
clearly the value that a well designed framework can provide to work with the
DOM and to automatically create functions to marshal to and from the JavaScript
Virtual Machine.
